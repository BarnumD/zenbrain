Artificial intelligence framework

## description

This is a machine "thought" program. It is essentially a map/reduce on arbitrary inputs and outputs. The machine can be tought to learn through strategies and ROIs.

## general progression

thoughts (map) -> thought processor (reduce) -> ticks (graphable) -> brain (reportable) -> simulation or triggers -> logs/ROI
